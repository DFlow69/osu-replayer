# osu-replayer

# What's missing (need to be implemented):
1. HTML Frontend
	We need an HTML file with all UI elements referenced in the JavaScript including:

		・ Tab buttons and convert content containers

		・ Input fields for replay and beatmap files

		・ Dropdowns for video quality, storyboard, cursor options

		・ Progress bars and status displays

		・ Result containers with video previews and download links

		・ Google Drive authentication UI elements


2. Environment Variables
   
	・ Set up proper environment variables for Google API credentials:

		・ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
 
		・ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

		・ GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL
  

3. Real Implementation of Backend Functions
 
	 The app.js file contains several placeholder functions that need real implementations:

		・ Real osu! API integration for downloading beatmaps

		・ Actual beatmap parsing and rendering

		・ Real video encoding with FFmpeg

		
4. Secure Key Storage
 
	Your Google API keys are exposed in the client-side code. In a productive environment you should:

		> Move client-side API keys to environment variables
 
		> Implement proper key rotation and security measures

		
5. Error Handling

	・ More comprehensive error handling, especially for:


		・ Network failures

		・ Invalid file formats

		・ API rate limiting

		・ File size limitations
		
6. File System Management

	・ Implement proper cleanup procedures for temporary files

	・ Add additional storage management for large video files


I have no idea what I am doing so be aware of anything that you might encounter (or might not)!
